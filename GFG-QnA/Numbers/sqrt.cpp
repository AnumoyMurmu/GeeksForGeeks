Given an integer x, find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(√x).

 

Example 1:

Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
Example 2:

Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect 
square, so its square root is 2.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function floorSqrt() which takes x as the input parameter and return its square root.
Note: Try Solving the question without using the sqrt function. The value of x>=0.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 ≤ x ≤ 107

// Function to find square root
// x: element to find square root
class Solution{
  public:
    long long int floorSqrt(long long int x) 
    {
        // Your code goes here
        
        long long int n = floor(sqrt(x));
        return n;
    }
